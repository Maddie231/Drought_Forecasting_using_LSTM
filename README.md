# LSTM Model for Time Series Prediction  

This repository contains an implementation of Uni-variate and Multi-variate Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models for time series prediction.  

## Overview  
- **Random Classifier Accuracy**: Achieved 86% accuracy but limited in retaining prior data for future prediction.  
- **LSTM Advantages**: Designed to store and retrieve information across longer sequences, learning temporal patterns effectively.  
- **Experiments**: Conducted with both Uni-variate and Multi-variate LSTM models for predictive analysis. LSTM models performed well when compared to Randomforest in forecasting the drought

## Features  
- Handles sequential data efficiently.  
- Learns temporal dependencies.  
- Predicts time series values with high accuracy.
